/**
 * dsh-boot-animation - host half.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript with no DSH SDK imports, so it needs no compiler and no DSH
 * source checkout: `scripts/build.sh` copies this file to lib/index.js.
 *
 * It serves the intro video and nothing else. Four details matter:
 *
 * 1. Range requests. Browsers issue them for media, and a video element that
 *    gets a 200 where it expected 206 sometimes refuses to play at all.
 *
 * 2. A LIBRARY, not a single slot. The plugin used to pick one asset off a
 *    three-level list, so adding a second video meant overwriting the first.
 *    Now every clip in every source is listed, the user picks one in the UI, and
 *    the choice is remembered. The old three-level priority is kept as the
 *    fallback when nothing has been picked, so an existing drop-in
 *    (`$DSH_HOME/boot-animation/intro.mp4`) keeps working untouched.
 *
 * 3. The two clips the plugin ships are EMBEDDED IN CODE, not files. There is no
 *    `assets/boot.mp4` or `videos/*.mp4` to lose, be filtered out of the package,
 *    or be shipped with the wrong container flags. `lib/clips.meta.js` carries
 *    the names and sizes; `lib/clips.data.js` carries the base64 bytes and is
 *    imported LAZILY, so the host does not parse ~8MB it may never need.
 *    A user's own files still work exactly as before and still win.
 *
 * 4. Everything is resolved PER REQUEST, so a user can drop in their own file
 *    without restarting DSH.
 *
 * Layout:
 *   $DSH_HOME/boot-animation/selection.json   which id plays (written by us)
 *   $DSH_HOME/boot-animation/videos/*.mp4     user library (drop-in)
 *   $DSH_HOME/boot-animation/intro.mp4        legacy drop-in, still honoured
 *   lib/clips.meta.js + lib/clips.data.js     the embedded built-in clips

/**
 * Every distinct clip the plugin can play: the embedded built-ins plus whatever

 *
 * Two de-duplications happen here, and both exist because the picker was showing

 *
 * 1. By real path, so `intro.mp4` is not listed twice (its directory is also a
 *    scan root).
 * 2. By CONTENT, so one clip is one row no matter how many copies of it exist.
 *    This is the case that actually confused a user: a copy of a built-in clip
 *    sat beside the built-in itself, under a different badge, and it read as
 *    "these are not the same kind of thing".
 *
 *    Identity is a content hash, not size+mtime. Embedded clips carry their
 *    sha256 in the metadata, and a file's hash is computed once and cached
 *    against (size, mtime) — so an exact duplicate is recognised even when its
 *    mtime differs, which size+mtime could not do. The cost is bounded: a hash
 *    per distinct file, once per process.
 *
 *    When copies collide the EMBEDDED entry wins: it cannot be deleted or lost,
 *    so a selection pointing at it always resolves. The user's file stays where
 *    it is — collapsed in the LIST, never on disk.
